            <b>Grilled Teriyaki Shrimp & Pineapple Skewers</b>
        </p>
         <p>Discription: These savory-sweet shrimp skewers are easy to make and cook in just a few minutes. They are perfect for summer weeknights or weekend dinner parties. Prep the sauce ahead of time for an even faster dinner. I prefer to use jumbo shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), however use what you have on hand. <b>Note:</b>This Discription was taken from the websit</p>

           <h3>Ingredients needed:</h3>
           <h4>Suace:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1/3 cup of water</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 <b>teaspoon</b> of honey</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon of grated fresh garlic</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon of grated fresh ginger</li>
                <li>1 pound of jumbo shrimp</li>
                <li>1/2 fresh pineapple, cored and <a>cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces</a></li>
                <li>skewers</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of minced fresh cilantro</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon of toasted sesame seeds</li>
                
            </ul>
         </p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><h2>Directions:</h2>
            <ol>

                <li>Combine water, soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, garlic, and ginger in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce has reduced and thickened slightly, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate. Thread shrimp and pineapple alternately onto skewers and place on a platter.</li>
                <li>Arrange skewers on the hot grate. Grill 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until shrimp is opaque and cooked through. Turn grill to low heat and brush sauce on both sides of skewers. Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with cilantro and sesame seeds.</li>
            
            </ol>
            <h3>Helpful tips & notes:</h3>
            <p>Try to cut the pineapple chunks approximately the same size as the shrimp for even grilling.

                If using wooden skewers, soak in water for 30 minutes before using to prevent burning.
